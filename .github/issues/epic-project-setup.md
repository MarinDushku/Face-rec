## Task Information

**Type:** Epic

**Status:** Planning

**Dependencies:** Project initialization complete

**Priority:** High

## Description

### Summary
Epic issue for Face-rec Project Setup encompassing all core modules and initial functionality for the custom face detection and recognition system.

### Background
This Epic covers the foundational development of a React + TypeScript application that performs real-time face detection and recognition using custom algorithms without external libraries like face-api.js.

### CLI Mapping
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run test         # Run all tests
npm run lint         # Code quality checks
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript validation
```

## Implementation Details

### Checklist/Subtasks
- [ ] #2 - Scaffold React project with basic webcam capture components
- [ ] #3 - Implement frame preprocessing + basic detection module  
- [ ] #4 - Design and implement recognition logic for consistent face IDs
- [ ] Integration testing across all modules
- [ ] Performance optimization (30 FPS target)
- [ ] Documentation updates

### Estimate
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Complexity:** High

## Acceptance Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Real-time webcam capture working
- [ ] Basic face detection algorithm implemented
- [ ] Face recognition with consistent ID assignment
- [ ] UI overlay showing bounding boxes and face count
- [ ] All tests passing with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Performance target of 30 FPS achieved
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Success Metrics
- Detect faces with 80%+ accuracy on standard webcam input
- Maintain 30 FPS performance during detection
- Consistent face ID assignment across frames
- Memory usage under 200MB

## Test Cases

### Unit Tests
- VideoStreamer webcam access and frame capture
- Preprocessor image processing functions
- FaceDetector algorithm accuracy with test images
- FaceRecognizer descriptor matching logic

### Integration Tests
- Full pipeline: webcam → detection → recognition → UI
- Cross-browser webcam API compatibility
- Performance benchmarks under load

### Manual Testing
- Test with multiple faces in frame
- Test face movement and tracking
- Test different lighting conditions
- Test browser permission handling

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
- `src/components/VideoFeed/` - Webcam capture component
- `src/components/FaceOverlay/` - Detection overlay UI
- `src/core/VideoStreamer.ts` - Video stream management
- `src/core/Preprocessor.ts` - Image preprocessing
- `src/core/FaceDetector.ts` - Detection algorithm
- `src/core/FaceRecognizer.ts` - Recognition logic

### API Changes
- New interfaces for Face, BoundingBox, FaceDescriptor
- VideoStream management types
- Detection and recognition result types

### Performance Considerations
- Real-time processing at 30 FPS
- Memory-efficient face descriptor storage
- Optimized canvas rendering for overlays

## Risks and Considerations

### Potential Issues
- Browser webcam permission handling
- Performance degradation with multiple faces
- Algorithm accuracy in varying lighting
- Cross-browser compatibility issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Graceful fallbacks for permission denied
- Adaptive processing based on face count
- Preprocessing normalization for lighting
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Breaking Changes
- None (new project)
